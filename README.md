## TODO

1. Restrict changes to groups after competition starts
2. Figure out how best to handle group minimum of 5.. Perhaps exclude the group from the team scoreboard if less than 5 members?
3. Styling!!
4. Performance: Calculate scoreboard state once daily instead of on each page load.

## Getting started

1. Download grails 2.2.5, unpack somewhere
2. Create `GRAILS_HOME` environment variable, pointed to the grails-2.2.5 folder
3. Add `%GRAILS_HOME%\bin` to system path
4. Checkout git repository
5. Inside repo folder, open the grails console from cmd/terminal: `grails`
6. Run the app: `run-app`
